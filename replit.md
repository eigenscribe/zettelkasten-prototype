# Zettelkasten-Diataxis Math Journal (PreTeXt Edition)

## Overview

This is a Zettelkasten-Diataxis hybrid mathematics journal built with PreTeXt. The project combines networked note-taking (Zettelkasten method) with PreTeXt's powerful mathematical typesetting and web publishing. Content is organized using the Diataxis framework (Prototypes, Tutorials, Explanations, Reference) and features MathJax for beautiful mathematical rendering, proper academic citations via BibTeX, and custom styling that preserves the original cyan-purple gradient design aesthetic.

## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.
Content: No AI-generated content except layout and styling. Sample prototype notes include AI warnings.

## Recent Changes

### PreTeXt Conversion (Nov 13, 2025)
- **Complete Migration**: Converted entire project from React/Vite to PreTeXt XML format
- **Content Preservation**: All mathematical notes (topology, metric spaces, continuous functions, sequences) migrated to PreTeXt sections
- **Citation System**: Implemented proper `<cite>` elements linking to backmatter bibliography (luhmann1984, munkres2000, rudin1976, spivak2008, apostol1974)
- **Custom Styling**: Preserved original cyan-purple gradient design using CSS injection via `build.sh` script
- **Glassmorphic Effects**: Maintained dark theme with backdrop blur effects on masthead, sidebar, content areas, and footer
- **Typography Preservation**: Aclonica font for all headings (with gradient effects), Merriweather serif for body text, Fira Code for code blocks
- **Build Workflow**: Created custom `build.sh` script that builds PreTeXt HTML and injects custom CSS automatically
- **Development Server**: PreTeXt server running on port 5000 with live preview capability
- **Project Structure**: Clean XML organization with source files in `/source/`, assets in `/assets/`, output in `/output/web/`
- **Navigation Styling**: All buttons (top nav and footer) use glassmorphic gradient backgrounds with cyan-to-purple theme and smooth hover animations
- **Footer Branding**: Custom eigenscribe © 2025 footer with dragon logo and gradient text, centered navigation buttons  
- **Selected Section Styling**: Active TOC sections have transparent background with cyan left border (4px) to avoid color clash with gradient text
- **Page Footer**: Custom eigenscribe © 2025 branding with dragon logo replaces default PreTeXt/Runestone/MathJax attribution links at page bottom

### Original React Version (Nov 10, 2025)

### Tag System Enhancement
- Implemented pill-style tags with 50px border radius matching reference design
- Updated all tags to use Aclonica font for visual consistency
- Added gradient backgrounds and hover effects to tags throughout the application
- Sidebar tags reduced to minimal size (0.55rem) for clean, compact appearance
- Tags now have smooth transitions and subtle shadow effects

### Diataxis Note Grouping System
- Implemented collapsible note groups in sidebar following Diataxis framework
- Five category groups: Prototypes, Tutorials, How-to Guides, Explanations, Reference
- All groups show count including zeros for transparency (e.g., "PROTOTYPES (4)", "TUTORIALS (0)")
- All groups start collapsed by default for clean initial view
- Groups visually grouped with subtle background containers
- Tighter spacing between notes for cohesive appearance
- Empty groups show "No notes yet" placeholder to indicate available categories
- All groups expand/collapse independently with smooth animations
- Current sample notes categorized under "Prototypes" group

### Note Metadata Refinement
- Reorganized note header: title first, then tags (left) and ID (right)
- Note ID badge with magical purple glow effect and square corners for vintage indexing aesthetic
- ID displays as compact digital-style badge with subtle neon effect
- Tags positioned below title for better visual hierarchy
- Reduced metadata size for cleaner content presentation

### Linked Notes Enhancement
- Linked notes now display note titles instead of IDs for better readability
- Redesigned linked note buttons with subtle, minimal styling
- Buttons use muted colors and only highlight on hover
- Smooth horizontal slide animation on hover
- Changed from monospace to body font for natural reading

### User Assets Integration
- Integrated custom dragon logo in header
- Set triquetra knot as browser favicon
- Applied mystical wisp background with glowing cyan orbs
- Added orb decoration to footer with soft glow effect

### Knowledge Graph Visualization
- Implemented interactive knowledge graph page to visualize note network connections
- Physics-based force-directed graph shows all notes as nodes with bidirectional links as edges
- Nodes color-coded by Diataxis category (purple for prototypes, with distinct colors for other categories)
- Node sizes reflect connection count - more linked notes appear larger
- Custom canvas rendering with Aclonica font labels and glowing effects matching site aesthetics
- Click-to-navigate functionality - clicking any node navigates to that note in the main view
- Header navigation with "Notes" and "Graph" links for seamless page switching
- Legend showing category color mappings for easy interpretation
- Glassmorphic container with backdrop blur maintains visual consistency with rest of app
- Graph auto-zooms to fit all nodes on load for optimal initial view
- Responsive design with mobile-optimized layouts
